            <h2>Why Does the Keto Diet Promote Eating Fat?</h2>
            <p>The ketogenic diet is based around the body entering a state of ketosis. In laypersons terms, ketosis means that the body does not burn carbohydrates for energy &#150; mainly because, if you are following keto, there will be very few carbs. As a back-up, the body starts burning fat.</p>
            <p>Initially, your body will burn off existing fat reserves. This is a reason the keto diet is so popular with people looking to lose weight. After a while, however, pre-stored fat will run dry. You will still need to fuel your body at this stage though.</p>
            <p>This is why, to remain in ketosis, you'll need to consume plenty of fat. If you live an appropriately active lifestyle and maintain a sensible calorie intake, your body will burn off fat as quickly as you can consume it.</p>

            <h2>What Fats are Good and Bad on the Keto Diet?</h2>
            <p>Initially, the idea of fat being appealing on the keto diet may feel a little strange. Dieters have long been told that any kind of fat is the enemy of good health. That is an oversimplification.</p>
            <p>Certain fats, most notably monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, are good for the body. Some nutritionists would even describe them as essential. The fats to avoid, whether you are following the keto diet or not, are artificial trans fats.</p>
            <p>These fats, which have long been linked with heart disease, are most commonly found in baked goods and sweets, processed meats, ready meals and fried foods. The good news is, as these foods are also packed with sugar, you will likely have made your peace with cutting them out of your diet anyway.</p>

            <h2>Can I Eat as Much Fat as I Like on the Keto Diet?</h2>
            <p>Even in ketosis, the human body needs an appropriate balance of all major food groups. You will need to cut down on your carbohydrates and replace them with fats, but you cannot eat nothing but fat and expect to see results.</p>
            <p>The average ketogenic dieter consumes somewhere in the region of 70% (some will go as far as 75%) of their calories in fat, with protein and carbs making up the rest. If you live an active lifestyle, consider upping your protein intake and slightly reducing the fats in your diet. You will only be able to tell once you have started your new plan.</p>
            <p>You will always need at least 60% of your daily calories to come from fat while in ketosis. Just do not go too far with the dietary shift.</p>
            <p>Be aware that anybody following the keto diet must be strict about these ratios. If you cheat on your diet, thinking that sneaking in some carbs here and there cannot hurt, you will be subjecting yourself to the worst of both worlds. Your body will exit ketosis and return to burning carbs for energy &#150; and all that fat that you have been consuming will once again be stored in reserve, leading to weight gain and potential health concerns.</p>

            <h2>What Fatty Foods are Considered Keto-Friendly?</h2>
            <p>As discussed, not all fats are equal on the keto diet. Let us review some of the foods that you should seriously consider consuming regularly.</p>

            <h3>Nuts</h3>
            <p>Nuts are a cornerstone of the keto diet. They are a great way to bring fat and protein into your diet, as well as bolstering heart health. You can either keep a bowl of nuts around, grabbing a handful to snack on when you feel yourself lagging in energy, or sprinkle them over salads. Just be conscious that a small handful now and again does not mean that they are a substitute for proper meals.</p>
            <p>Practice appropriate moderation with nuts, though. Some types, especially cashews, pistachios and almonds, can send your carb consumption skyrocketing. Pecans and Brazil nuts offer the best fat-to-carb ratio.</p>

            <h3>Olives and Olive Oil</h3>
            <p>The Mediterranean diet is often held up as a flagship for healthy eating, and olives are a key component of such an eating plan. The good news is that olives are keto-friendly, as well as being wholly versatile.</p>
            <p>Whether you are snacking on them whole or chopping your olives up to include in a salad, they have plenty of benefits. Olive oil should also become your go-to lubricant when frying over the hob and can be drizzled over other foods to add a little more flavour.</p>

            <figure class="bt-pink pad-all-small punch gutter-base">
              <figcaption class="flag pos-outside-ne bt-red">Avoid</figcaption>
              <h2 class="h5">There are oils that you should avoid, however. These are:</h2>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                  <ul class="list-progress">
                    <li>Corn</li>
                    <li>Canola</li>
                    <li>Grapeseed</li>
                    <li>Canola</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                  <ul class="list-progress">
                    <li>Rice bran</li>
                    <li>Sunflower</li>
                    <li>Saffron</li>
                    <li>Soybean</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
              </div>
            </figure>

            <p>These fats include the highest amount of polyunsaturated fat. You may find it hard to completely avoid them but do keep them to a minimum.</p>

            <h3>Butters</h3>
            <p>Butters are GOOD on keto. If you have been a &#145;dairy&#146; person when thinking of butter, or are following vegan principles, there are other options, such as nut butters that you can use.</p>

            <figure class="bt-pale-avacado pad-all-small punch gutter-large mt-5 gutter-base">
              <figcaption class="flag pos-outside-ne bt-avacado">Good</figcaption>
              <h2 class="h5">In summary, the best oils/butters/cooking fats depend on what and how you are cooking, i.e., frying, roasting, baking:</h2>
              <ul class="list-progress">
                <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>Refined coconut oil</li>
                <li>Avocado oil</li>
                <li>Pasture-raised lard (leaf for baking), tallow, ghee, or duck fat</li>
              </ul>
            </figure>

            <figure class="bt-pale-avacado pad-all-small punch gutter-large gutter-large">
              <figcaption class="flag flag-south pos-outside-se bt-avacado">Good</figcaption>
              <h2 class="h5">For salad dressings, the following:</h2>
              <ul class="list-progress">
                <li><abbr title="medium-chain triglyceride">MCT</abbr> oil (with at least 50% C8 content to promote ketosis)</li>
                <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>Avocado oil</li>
                <li>High-oleic sunflower/safflower oil</li>
              </ul>
            </figure>

            <p>When talking about <q>best</q> fats, here is one of our other top tips. Unless you have come across it before, and the chances are you have not, MCT oil is somewhat of a buzz word in the keto world. You can use it to up your fat intake and it is believed to be healthy in assisting weight loss. Try stirring it into tea or coffee, mixing it in smoothies or into a salad dressing, to get that extra fat boost. Not only that, but it also contains around 10% less calories than foods such as nuts, avocados and even olive oil.</p>

            </figure>

            <h3>Fish</h3>
            <p>As discussed previously, appropriate levels of protein are just as important to a successful keto diet as fat. If you consume plenty of fish &#150; for the avoidance of doubt, that means fish with scales, not breadcrumbs &#150; you will enjoy the best of both worlds. Tuna, mackerel, herring and salmon, in particular, are great for anybody following a keto lifestyle. Generally speaking, these are known as <q>oily fish</q>.</p>
            <p>Seafood such as prawns, lobster etc., have little or no carbs and are not particularly high in calories. However, the leaner the fish, the lower the fat content, so you would need to up the fat content by using other foodstuffs as part of your meal.</p>

            <h3>Dairy</h3>
            <p>If you have been avoiding butter for years, reluctantly switching to a variant low-fat spread, we have good news. Butter is around 80% fat, and it is ideal for anybody attempting to force their body into ketosis. You will have to ensure the butter is of appropriately high quality, ideally organic and originating from grass-fed cows. Once you have brought butter back into your life, toss your vegetables in it to make a delicious and appealing keto dinner.</p>
            <p>The same goes for cheese. Whether you are slicing cheese into sticks as a snack or grating it over a meal, high-quality cheese is a great way to bring fat into your diet. Gouda and cheddar are the ideal choices, but if you are buying a superior brand, you can rarely go wrong. Give serious consideration to visiting a deli counter over an off-the-shelf supermarket product to stand yourself in good stead. Good news is that there are also options for vegetarians and vegans today, which there certainly was not around 10 years ago.</p>

            <h3>Yoghurt</h3>
            <p>Fat-free or low-fat yoghurt is always a dubious choice for dieters. Most yoghurts that eschew fat will be packed with more sugar than anybody with serious ambitions to enter ketosis can consider. Thankfully, full-fat Greek yoghurt is the perfect keto breakfast &#150; especially when paired with berries.</p>
            <p>The use of fat on the keto diet is typically very welcome. Unlike many diets, you will not necessarily need to sacrifice flavour in your meals. Just be careful about your fat consumption. Keto is not a free-for-all, enabling you to eat anything you desire &#150; and remember, the more fat you consume, the more important than ever it becomes to ensure that you moderate your carbohydrates. Every diet in the world needs some element of discipline and perseverance.</p>
